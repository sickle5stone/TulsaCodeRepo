# test
The test directory is used to store all of the .test.js files. The test files are placed here to
keep the app directory from becoming cluttered. Also, it makes it easier for bundlers to bundle
the app directory into a single JavaScript file as the bundler won't have to worry about
excluding test files. All test files should end in the extension .test.js. The directory
structure of test should mirror that of app.
